Plugin Documentation
====================

Plugin documentation must be located in "Lima/camera/dectector/name/doc". It is composed of at least an "index.rst" file which contains informations to install, configure and implement a camera plugin. The presence of this documentation is required to share a plugin with Lima community.

Plugins documentation is available in the section "Supported Cameras".

The table below describes informations taht must be present in the index file :

Architecture
============

Library structure
------------------

The library structure divided into two main layers: control, containing the common control and processing code, and hardware, implementing the detector-specific part.
The control layer provides the library interface to the high level application. User requests to configure and control the acquisition are gathered by the control layer,
so the hardware layer functionality is limited to the generation the image frames in a best-effort basis. The control layer is responsible of: 
i) adapting the received image geometry if it does not match the user requests, and ii) execute the frame processing chain.

Understanding the generic Interface
------------------------------------

The Hardware Layer defines the interface between the Control Layer and the controller library. It provides the minimal functionality needed for the Control Layer to
satisfy the user requests. 
The main class in the Hardware Layer is the HwInterface, providing the interface to the Control Layer. In order to provide a flexible and evolvable interface,
the configuration of this layer is implemented as a set of features (capabilities) that may or may not be implemented by the hardware. 
The capabilities can be grouped in three categories: 

1. Standard: includes the synchronization parameters (exposure time, ext. trigger, etc), the detector informations (Detector model, Max size, etc..) is considered standard and must be implemented for all detectors. 
2. Extended\*: optional common features like image transformations (binning, RoI, flip), advanced acquisition modes (kinetics, frame transfer), and extended mechanisms (camera serial line)
3. Specific\*: these are detector-specific features that can not be treated in a generic interface

Hardware Interface << HwInterface>>
-----------------------------------

As an interface to the Control Layer, this class exports the capabilities provided by the hardware: 
* getCapList() 
It also contains the high level commands to control the acquisition: 

* prepare() 
* start() 
* stop() 
* getStatus() 
* getNbAcquiredFrames() 
* getStartTimeStamp() 

The getStatus() function should return the following information: 

=============== ============
Parameters       Description
=============== ============
AcqStatus        Global acquisition status: Ready/Running/Fault
DetStatus        Compound bit flags specifying the current detector status: 
                   * Fault 
                   * WaitForTrigger 
                   * ShutterOpen 
                   * Exposure

                   * ChargeShift 
                   * Readout
DetStatusMask    A mask specifying the detector status bits that are supported by the hardware

Standard Capabilities
----------------------

These capabilities are mandatory for all the detectors. They define the minimum functionality necessary for image acquisition.

                   * Internal: software triggering 
                   * ExtStart: one external signal to start the whole sequence acquisition (one or more frames per 
                     sequence) 
                   * MultExtStart: one external signal for each frame in the acquisition sequence 
                   * Gate: controls start and stop of each frame

================ ======================================================================================================

Buffer Management << HwBufferCtrlObj >>
``````````````````````````````````````````````

This block controls the image memory buffer allocation and management. They are used: 
* As temporary frame storage before saving, allowing disk/network speed fluctuations. 
* To permanently hold images that can be read by the user after the acquisition is finished. 

These buffer functionalities may be implemented by the hardware layer (kernel driver in the case of the Espia). 
If not, an auxiliary buffer manager class will be provided to facilitate (and unify) its software implementation. 
The buffer management parameters are: 

=============== ======================================================================================================
Parameters       Description
=============== ======================================================================================================
NbBuffers        Number of image buffers in memory.
NbConcatFrames   The number of concatenated frames per buffer.
NbAccFrames      The number of detector frames to accumulate into a single buffer.
MaxNbBuffers     This Read-Only parameter indicates the maximum number of buffers that can be allocated, 
                 given the size of the frame and the number of (concatenated) frames per buffer.
BufferMode       Buffer filling mode (linear or circular)
=============== ======================================================================================================

The buffer manager must also provide the following methods: 
* getBufferPtr(int buffer_nb) 
* getFramePtr(int acq_frame_nb) 
* getFrameTimeStamp(int acq_frame_nb) 

Frame callback
``````````````````````````````````````````````

The hardware must provide callbacks after each acquired frame. The callback function should receive the following information: 

=============== ======================================================================================================
Parameters       Description
=============== ======================================================================================================
AcqFrameNb       Index of the frame since the start of the acquisition
FramePtr         Pointer to the frame memory
FrameDim         Structure holding the width, height and type of the frame
TimeStamp        Time (in sec.) since the start of the acquisition
=============== ======================================================================================================

The frame callbacks are implemented by means of an auxiliary class (FrameCallback), which will be used by the Control Layer.
From the Hardware Layer point of view, the standard capability control object must implement two functions: 

* setFrameCallbackActive(bool cb_active) 
* frameReady(<callback_frame_info>) 

Developer guidelines
====================
This chapter provides general guidelines to follow, to share a plugin with the **LIMA** community.

Source code
-----------

 - **Plug-ins directory**
  The source files and documentation of each new plug-in must be located under Lima/Camera as shown figure below. 
  
   .. image:: plugin_arbo.png
   
   To maintain homogeneity between the different plug-ins, each plug-in must have at minimum the following folders: 
   
  - **src** : contains the source files. Plug-ins must be developed in C++.
  
   The "src" folder must contain the following files :
    - DetectorNameCamera.cpp : interface class with the detector librairies **(mandatory)**
    - DetectorNameInterface.cpp : interface class between detector capabilities from the hardware interface and the control layer **(mandatory)**
    - DetectorNameDetInfoCtrObj.cpp : capabilities to get static informations about the detector **(mandatory)**
    - DetectorNameBufferCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to control the image memory buffer allocation **(mandatory)**
    - DetectorNameSyncCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to control the image memory buffer allocation **(mandatory)**
    - DetectorNameRoiCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to get a ROI **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameBinCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to make pixel binning **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameVideoCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to make video mode only for non-scientific detectors **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameShutterCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to control shutter **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameFlipCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to flip image **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameEventCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to generate event **(optional)**
    - DetectorNameSavingCtrlObj.cpp : capabilities to save images in different formats **(optional)**
	
   **If optional capabilities are not defined, they are emulated by the Lima Core.**
  
  - **include** : contains the header files relative to the sources files described before.
  - **doc** : contains at least "index.rst" for plug-in documentation. Other files such as image can be added. The minimum content of the index file is detailed in the documentation section.	
  - **Other** : Other folders can be added based on need. The contents of this file must be described in the documentation.
   
 - **Camera device**
  Once the plug-in was developed, you must create a camera device to execute all commands on the camera. This device can be developed in Python or C++. Python devices must be located on "Lima/applications/tango/camera", C++ devices on "Lima/applications/tango/LimaDetector"
  
  It is recommended that the camera device comply with the design guidelines of a TANGO device. These few rules are described below :
  
  - **Tango design guidelines**
   
    In order to enhance the general software quality of Device Servers developed by the various institutes using Tango, a Design and Implementation Guidelines document has been written by SOLEIL. This document can be downloaded form thr URL : `http://www-controle.synchrotron-soleil.fr:8001/docs/TangoGuidelines/TangoDesignGuidelines-GB4-3.pdf `

Development of a new camera plug-in
======================================

For each new type of detector **detectorname**, a camera plug-in must be created and added to Lima.
The integration of **detectorname** plug-in in Lima is done in several stages:

Add source files of the plug-in to the Lima project
----------------------------------------------------

The source files of each plug-in are located under Lima/camera directory as shown in Figure 2

.. figure:: dir_structure.png
   
   Figure 2.
   
Filenames
------------

To maintain homogeneity between the different plug-ins, each plug-in must have at minimum the following files:
DetectorNameCamera.cpp 	(to put in the subdirectory src/)
DetectorNameCamera.h 	(to put in the subdirectory include/)

DetectorNameInterface.cpp 	(to put in the subdirectory src/)
DetectorNameInterface.h 	(to put in the subdirectory include/)

Additionally, there could be others files depending of the camera capabilities. Here is the nomenclature to follow:

For Sync capability: (trigger types\.\.\.)

DetectorNameSyncCtrlObj.cpp 	(to put in the subdirectory \src)
DetectorNameSyncCtrlObj.h 		(to put in the subdirectory \include)

For Det Info capability: (image size, pixel size\.\.\.)

DetectorNameDetInfoCtrlObj.cpp 	(to put in the subdirectory \src)
DetectorNameDetInfoCtrlObj.h 	(to put in the subdirectory \include)

For Roi capability:

DetectorNameRoiCtrlObj.cpp 		(to put in the subdirectory \src)
DetectorNameRoiCtrlObj.h 		(to put in the subdirectory \include)

For Binning capability:

DetectorNameBinCtrlObj.cpp 		(to put in the subdirectory \src)
DetectorNameBinCtrlObj.h 		(to put in the subdirectory \include)


Of course, there can also be other files source for specific cases.

Class names
------------

Again, to maintain homogeneity, it is recommended to follow this nomenclature for the class names:

* **DetectorName**::Camera

* **DetectorName**::Interface

* **DetectorName**::SyncCtrlObj

* **DetectorName**::DetInfoCtrlObj
 
As an example, one can look at the Prosilica plugin for a real implementation or at the simulator plugin for a implementation model.

Use the Interface:  client side
--------------------------------

In order to communicate with the underlying detector hardware, the lima client must instantiate the main object of the framework Lima: CtControl.
To be instantiated, the CtControl requires an interface inherited from common HwInterface.
This interface requires the Camera object that encapsulates dependency with detector and its API driver.

For instance if you are using the python binding for the Prosilica camera, a client application initialization should do:

.. code-block:: python

   from Lima import Prosilica as ProsilicaAcq
   from Lima import Core

   my_prosilica_ip_address = 192.168.1.2
   # we need the camera object first
   camera = Prosilica.camera(my_prosilica_ip_address)

   # create the HwInterface which needs the camera as unique parameter
   camera_interface =  ProsilicaAcq.Interface(camera)

   # Now create the CtControl and passed to Lima the new HwInterface
   Control = Core.CtControl(camera_interface)

The camera is now under control and it can be used  to acquire images !
First get the sub-objects for the parameter setting of the detector, acquisition, saving and more if necessary.

.. code-block:: python

   acq = control.acquisition()
   saving = control.saving()

   acq.setAcqExpoTime(0.1)
   acq.setAcqNbFrames(10)

   pars=saving.getParameters()
   pars.directory='/buffer/test_lima'
   pars.prefix='test1_'
   pars.suffix='.edf'
   pars.fileFormat=Core.CtSaving.EDF
   pars.savingMode=Core.CtSaving.AutoFrame
   saving.setParameters(pars)
   
   # pass parameters to camera hw interface
   control.prepareAcq()
   
   # start the acquisition
   control.startAcq()


*NB*:
Camera object is only used to enhance the separation between the generic interface and the API driver of the detector. It is similar to a proxy.

The camera class is also supposed to provide an access to the specific configuration of the detector. For instance if your detector has a threshold setting or a built-in background correction available you should implement these features in the Camera class. The HwInterface will not know about the specific configuration and a client application should explicitly implement the configuration. A good example is the Andor camera, where there are few extra features  like the temperature set-point (set/getTemperatureST()) or the cooler control (set/getCooler(bool)).

With the Andor camera one can set the cooling as:

.. code-block:: python
 
   camera.setTemperatureSP(-50)
   camera.setCooler(True)

   current_temp = Camera.getTemperature()


The Lima project code provides some client application based on TANGO protocol for the remote access.
One can find a python implementation under applications/tango and a C++ version in applications/tango/LimaDetector.
The python server has been developed at ESRF and being used on lot of beamlines and the C++ server is the SOLEIL version which is also used on beamlines.

The python server interface has a documentation available at lima.blissgarden.org (applications/tango/doc/index.html).
